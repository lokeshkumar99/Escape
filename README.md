Our Idea is to develope a tech which helps the user to locate and reach the nearest Secure place.
We are going to use Machine Learning to predict whether a place is safe using the satellite image of the same in the real time.
We also get the inputs from users who convey about their status i.e whether they are safe or not and through the GPS we shall come to know about the location they are talking about and would save the data.
Since both the user given and the predicted is being used the predicted result would have an higher chance of being the right one.
So with the help of these datas when a user gives a distress call we are able to decide the safest place nearby to him and give him the shortest route to the same.
Dijkstra Algorithm is to be used by us to predict the shortest route .
Thus a user with the help of our tech will come to know about the safest path and can reach to the safety.
The work of the tech doesnt just stop here, We would have some extra Add ons through which the user can get to know about the nearby Releif camps and the vaccancy in them.
We also let the people update about their statusin the database through which their friends and family know about their condition.
Similarly NGO's shall have the access to all these database so that they can help those people easily when they come to know about the need quantitatively
The same goes with the Rescue force too.

We also provide the user with updates on the relief operations and help the rescue team to know about the requirements and conditons of the people who have taken accomodatation.
